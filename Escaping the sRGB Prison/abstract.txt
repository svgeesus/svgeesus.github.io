Escaping the sRGB Prison

Imagine that I told you that you are only allowed to use
two-thirds of the colors that your screen can display.
All the brightest and most vivid shades are not allowed.
Unacceptable, right?!
Welcome to Web design for the last seven years.
You might not know it but compared to native apps,
you are in the sRGB Prison.
After attending this talk you will understand
the measurable, reproducible sensation we call color.
You will understand Lab and OKLab color spaces,
be comfortable with gamut volume plots,
and be able to laugh at snake-oil claims
about color gamut coverage in advertising.
Having broken out of jail,
and knowing the basics of perceptual uniformity,
you will be really looking forward to seeing
CSS Color 4 and 5 implemented in all browsers.
This is an intermediate to advanced talk
about the  current state and near future
of cutting edge color on the Web.
