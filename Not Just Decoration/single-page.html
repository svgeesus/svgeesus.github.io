<dt>Abstract:</dt> 

<dd>In some applications, high quality graphics are essential.  This
paper reviews factors affecting the display of accurate
graphical information in a heterogenous networked environment,
concentrating on the areas that must be addressed to implement Web user
agents which offer good color fidelity.  Image rendition strategies for
a color-scarce environment are described and the color allocation
strategies of several popular Web browsers are examined.  Given current
trends in provision of device independent color, projected future needs
for Web user agents are described.  Lastly, the implications of embedded
image metadata are discussed.</dd>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The means of providing and using high quality textual information on
the Web has received a great deal of attention.  Of course, there is
still plenty of low-grade textual information out there.  But the
requirements are well understood and the infrastructure is in place for
those who wish to generate or use quality text.</p>

<p>Much graphical material on the Web is also of poor quality, but in
contrast the requirements for high quality graphics on the Web have
received much less attention.  Granted, many graphics are mere
adornment, but some are not.  Graphics can be valid information in their
own right.</p>

<p>It would also be dangerous and limiting to assume that browsing
constitutes the totality of present and future Web use.  In some
applications, the graphical component can be essential.  Thus, it makes
sense to evaluate the particular requirements for quality Web
graphics.</p>

<h3>Application areas</h3>

<p>A sample of existing and potential application areas dependent on high
quality images:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inline graphics were first added to the Web because they were needed
for a distributed, collaborative <i>scientific visualization</i> application.
Thus, NCSA Mosaic [<a href="#01">1</a>] was born.  Scientific
visualization remains an application where high quality graphics are an
essential requirement and where graphics constitute the bulk of the
information.

</li><li>Commercial applications such as <i>product design</i> and collaborative
evaluation of prototypes clearly benefit from using the Web, and also
require a high level of color fidelity in rendition of images.

</li><li>In the <i>medical</i> and <i>veterinary</i> fields, clear and portable images are
essential if clinical decisions are to be made using them; there is also
the need for tightly coupled image metadata for safety and liability
reasons.

</li><li>Accurate, repeatable device independent color representation is an
emerging key requirement in <i>advertising</i>.  Extreme care is currently
taken with printed materials to ensure consistent colors for such
things as brand identification and corporate identity, but the
infrastructure is only slowly being put in place to assure a similar
level of fidelity on the Web.

</li><li>Last but not least, computer graphics research has a clear need for
the dissemination of accurate images for viewing and analysis by
colleagues worldwide.
</li></ul>

<h3>Scope</h3> 

<p>This paper will survey some major areas affecting two-dimensional,
static, raster graphics quality.  Vector graphics (such as CGM), 
three-dimensional graphics (such as VRML), animations, and movies are not
considered.</p>

<p>It will focus on areas such as accurate color and tonal rendition
which may as yet be unfamiliar to developers of Web user agents.  Topics
which are important for Web graphics in general, but do not strictly
relate to graphics <i>quality</i>--such as compression
efficiency--are also outside the scope of this paper.</p>

<h2>Effect on Web User Agents</h2>

<p>Computer Graphics can be seen as a somewhat specialized 
area--particularly where accurate rendition is required.  Yet parts of it need
to be understood to produce good graphics.  Experience has shown that
users can be harshly critical of browsers with poor image quality, even
if these same browsers excel in other areas.  The thrust of this paper
is to pull together separate strands of computer graphics as they relate
to Web user agents, to make it easier to provide the increasingly high
levels of graphical quality that users are demanding.</p>


<p>A number of different quality requirements are discussed in this
paper.  Attempting to implement a single one of these in isolation can
be difficult, as there are strong interactions between them.  Partial
implementation still requires an awareness of the other factors.  This
paper highlights known interdependencies to make the implementor's job
easier and  prevent nasty surprises.</p>


<h2>Antialiasing--What Is It?</h2>

<p>Aliasing is an artifact caused by inadequate sampling frequency
(<a href="#alias">1</a>).  The term is most commonly applied to
spatial aliasing, which manifests as visible pixelation--a blocky or
jagged effect--especially with near horizontal or near vertical lines
of high contrast.  It is thus particularly noticed with textual
annotation of images.  Figure 1 shows a sample image, converted from a
PostScript file with one sample per pixel, that displays severe spatial
aliasing.</p>

<!-- Do NOT redraw this image. The defects are meant to be there -->
<p><img src="images/1perpix.png"><br>
Figure 1. A severely aliased image</p>

<h3>How Is Aliasing Reduced?</h3>

<p>Aliasing may be reduced by taking multiple samples of the underlying
information.  In the case of a computer graphics technique such as
raytracing, this involves shooting multiple rays through different parts
of each pixel.  In the case of PostScript conversion to images, this is
achieved by rasterizing at a higher resolution, then resampling down to
the intended resolution.  Figure 2 shows the same PostScript file
rendered with 16 samples per pixel.  Much less aliasing is seen.
Careful examination of the edges of lettering and the colored blocks
shows that the background and foreground colors have been blended together based on their subpixel coverage.</p>

<p><img src="images/16perpix.png"><br>
Figure 2. An antialiased image</p>


<h2>What is Transparency?</h2>

<p>Image file formats that support transparency are able to make certain
designated pixels wholly or partially transparent, so that the
background color or texture shows through.  In this way,
nonrectangular images may be simulated regardless of the background
color or texture of the user agent, as in seen in Figure 3.</p>

<!-- different from online version, to show transparent gif *effect* -->
<!-- <p><img src="images/02.html">  <img src="images/04.html">  <img src="images/03.html"><br>
Figure 3 An image with binary transparency, on different backgrounds</p> -->
<p><img src="images/seed-crambin.png"><br>
  <i>Figure 3: An image with binary transparency.</i></p>

<p>The simplest type of transparency is binary--each pixel is either
<i>on</i> or <i>off</i>.  This may be specified by a binary
transparency mask, or (particularly with palette-based formats) by
nominating a particular color or group of colors to be transparent.
The latter method is used by the GIF89a format [<a href="#04">4</a>] and is widely supported in current Web user
agents.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>There is a <b>severe interaction</b> between antialiasing
and binary transparency.  Because the background color of the image is
mixed in with the foreground colors, simply replacing a single
background color with another is not enough to simulate transparency.
There will be a whole host of shades which are <i>mixtures</i> of
background and foreground colors, as Figure 4 shows.  The effect in
this case is a white halo around objects, because the original image was
antialiased to a white background color.</p>

<!-- Do NOT redraw this image. The defects are meant to be there -->
<p><img src="images/16perpix-halo.png"><br>
Figure 4. Halo effect caused by anti-aliased edges</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>An improvement on binary transparency is variable transparency, also
known as an alpha mask or alpha channel.  Here each pixel can take any
value between fully opaque and fully transparent, and this value is
independent of the color of that pixel.  Besides allowing smooth
transitions between a graphic and the background, this permits a
different type of antialiasing.</p>

<p>Foreground colors contributing to a particular pixel are mixed
together according to their subpixel foreground coverage,
<i>ignoring</i> contribution from the background.  The alpha channel
value is used to express the fractional contribution of the original
background, irrespective of that background's color.  When rendered,
this alpha channel specifies for each pixel what proportion of the
existing background is to be mixed with the forground image data to
produce the final color of each pixel.  In this way, the antialiased
image can be displayed on any background or texture, or indeed
composited on top of another arbitrary image, without the artifacts seen
with binary transparency.</p>
 

<h2>Notes to Implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>There has been an increase in the number of antialiased images as
people strive for better quality, and this brings to the fore a number
of interactions.  That between antialiasing and binary transparency has
already been noted.  Also, antialiased images contain a lot more
colors than aliased ones, which puts pressure on the color allocation 
strategy.</p>

<p>Variable transparency is most easily implemented with a truecolor
display, because if any image pixel may be mixed with the user agent's
background color or texture in any proportion, the total number of
colors in a displayed image can become quite large.  It can be
implemented in a color-scarce environment provided an off screen buffer
is provided to composite the image before reducing it to the current
palette.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Future Web user agents should permit as inline images formats that
support variable transparency, to allow quality antialiased images that
are independent of the background color or texture.  Suitable formats
include extended TIFF [<a href="#05">5</a>] and PNG [<a href="#06">6</a>].  This will encourage information
providers to migrate away from formats that only support binary
transparency, such as GIF89a.</p>

<p>This will also allow the OVERLAY attribute of the draft HTML 3.0 FIG
element [<a href="#07">7</a>] to be deployed more effectively.
Overlays are only of use if one can also see what is being overlaid.</p>


<h2>Gamma Correction</h2>

<p>When expressing a color in RGB, what we are trying to specify is the
amount of light which will be emitted from each phosphor, as a fraction
of full power.  What we are <i>actually</i> specifying is, however, the
voltage which will be applied to each electron gun.</p>

<p> The two are not linearly related, because the amount of light
emitted is proportional to the beam power rather than the voltage.  The
beam power is the product of voltage and current, and current turns out
to be roughly proportional to the grid voltage to the power 1.5.  Thus,
the light emitted is proportional to the voltage to the power 2.5 or so.
The actual value of the exponent, called <i>gamma</i>, varies somewhat,
and the power law is only an an approximate model of the real situation,
albeit a good one.  An additional optical effect caused by viewing
images against a dim surround is that the effective gamma value is
somewhat reduced, from a theoretical 2.5 to around 2.2</p>

<!--   Oh for some real equations! Roll on the incorporation of 
       HTML 3.0 maths into HTML 2.x he said wistfully            -->

<p>To deal with this nonlinearity, the inverse power function (1/2.2)
is applied to the RGB data before display, compensating for the
nonlinearities which will be introduced.  Figure 5 shows a typical
correction curve, which is a mirror image about the line <tt>Input =
Output</tt> of the display nonlinearity.  (In other words, the display
nonlinearity curves down from a straight line, and so the gamma
correction curves up from that line [<a href="#08">8</a>].


</p><p><img src="images/gamma.png"><br>
Fig 5. A typical gamma correction curve</p>


<p>There are a number of places at which this correction could be
applied, and this affects how Web user agents handle image data.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the image data itself; in other words a correction has been
applied at the server end.

</li><li>In the user agent software; correction is being applied as the image is
streamed in.

</li><li>In the software of the underlying platform; the Apple Mac and SGI
workstations are examples of systems which apply some correction at this
stage, using corrections of 1/1.8 and 1/1.7 (by default)
respectively.

</li><li>In the hardware of the underlying platform, using
variable attenuation or amplification; the Barco Calibrator is an
example of a monitor which performs correction at this stage, using
test signals and measured luminance values to correct itself.
</li></ol>

<p>The end result of all these potential corrections, plus the display
nonlinearity, must equal a linear transformation for accurate tonal
reproduction to be obtained.  The Web user agent must therefore be aware
of the amount of correction from step one (in the image file received
from the server) and from steps two and three (provided by the
underlying platform) so that the appropriate correction can be made.

</p><h2>Gamma: Avoiding Guesswork</h2>

<p>With most image formats there is no way to determine if any
correction has been applied at step one, and if so, what value was used.
This results in considerable uncertainty among information providers as
to how to proceed.  The <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/coolbrz/psycho.html"> following quote</a> is
typical:</p>

<blockquote>We have no real stats on what people on the nets have and
what looks best.  Most Mac's wash out the colors while Windows 3.1 make
everything look dark.  We need to know what is the best approach to
providing free graphics.  Please let us know what you want!</blockquote>

<p>What is needed is for the image file to contain machine-readable
details of the correction that has been applied.  This facility has been
part of the Utah RLE format [<a href="#09">9</a>] for
several years.  TIFF files [<a href="#05">5</a>]
<i>can</i> contain very precise transfer curves although most in
practice do not.  PNG [<a href="#06">6</a>]also has the
facility to record any gamma correction that has been applied.  Kodak
PhotoCD [<a href="#10">10</a>] uses a single standard
transfer function.  Clearly, such formats make the user agent
implementor's job much easier.</p>


<h2>Notes to Implementors</h2>
<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>If an image is under or over gamma corrected, this also affects the
color balance.  Over correction (in addition to making mid-tones too
light) shifts colors towards neutral gray, while under correction (in
addition to making midtones too dark) shifts colors towards the
display primaries.</p>

<p>Viewing on screen and printing on paper are two processes with very
different transfer characteristics, so what is right for one is not
right for the other.  The extent of the mismatch depends on how much of
the required correction has already been done to the image, how much is
done in the viewing software, and how much (if any) is done by the
software or hardware of the underlying platform.</p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>User agents should provide some sort of gamma correction which does
the right thing in as many cases as possible.  This might be done
by, in order of importance:</p>

<ul>

<li>Honoring explicit source gamma declarations in those image files
that support them--currently TIFF, Utah RLE and PNG.  Encouraging use
of such formats to avoid guesswork.

</li><li>Providing well-chosen default settings, appropriate to the
underlying platform.

</li><li>Using suitable heuristics based on the Internet Media type for image
formats without explicit source gamma declarations.  For example, GIF
images typically have a source gamma of 0.45 (i.e., they are already
corrected, for most displays) while JPEG JFIF [<a href="#11">11</a>] files often have a source gamma of 1.0
(i.e., they are uncorrected).  Yes, this is a guess.  It <i>will</i>
sometimes be wrong.  It is however an improvement on providing no gamma
correction at all, or a blanket gamma correction on all types of images.

</li><li>Allowing setting of gamma in the preferences, for example, by
providing a slider to adjust the screen gamma by eye until
a user-agent-generated tone reproduction chart looks correct on screen,
and saving this value for future use.

</li><li>Allowing customization by knowledgeable users or those with stringent
requirements, for example by inputting measured transfer characteristics
or providing an interface for external programs to be called to aid in
accurate reproduction.</li></ul>

<p>User agents which offer printing should be aware of the different
gamma requirements for screen and print and might offer similar
facilities (allowing customization, printing a test chart) to adjust
gamma for printing.</p>


<h2>Color Display</h2>

<p>A quick spot of color theory before we can move on.  The 
bare minimum, really!  (<a href="#fncol">1</a>)</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>The color of an object depends not only on the precise spectrum of
light emitted or reflected from it but also on the observer--their
species, what else they can see, even what they have recently looked
at! Color is not an objective property of real-world objects; it is a 
subjective, biological sensation.</p>


<h3>So What Is Color, Anyway</h3>

<p>Given the preceding description of color sensation, one might be
forgiven for assuming that there is no way to cope with these
vagarties.  However, by treating the entire human eye/brain system as a
black box and performing color matching experiments upon it, it has
been possible to arrive at a surprisingly objective, measurable and
repeatable <i>model</i> of color that corresponds in large measure
with how we see color.  This system, invented and standardized in the
1930s by the International Commission on Lighting (Commission
Internationale de l'Eclairage, or CIE) [<a href="#14">14</a>]
is called CIE XYZ [<a href="#15">15</a>] and is capable of
representing all colors that can be seen by the human visual system.
The XYZ value of a color can be measured by physical instruments or
calculated from the spectrum of light given off by an object.</p>

<p><a name="different">When</a> we look at an image on a computer
screen, what we see depends on the precise color and intensity of light
emitted by each of the three phosphors in a computer monitor; this in
turn depends on the make and the model, plus less tangible factors (such
as the age--blue phosphors degrade faster than the other two).  In the
limit, each monitor is unique.  This means that the same R,G,B values
applied to two different monitors will give different colors;
similarly, to produce exactly the same color on two different monitors,
different R,G,B values must be applied.</p>

<h2>Gamut</h2>

<p>Provided the CIE XYZ measured colors of the red, green and blue
phosphors are available for a particular monitor, any RGB color on that
monitor can be converted to CIE XYZ.  Similarly, any measured CIE XYZ
color can be reproduced on that monitor, provided it falls within the
range of displayable colors--the <i>gamut</i>--bounded by the
monitor primaries.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the triangular gamut of one particular monitor, drawn
on a chromaticity diagram.  This is a way of reducing the three
dimensional CIE XYZ space to two dimensions by removing the brightness
information (light orange and dark orange map the the same
chromaticities).  Different monitors will have different gamuts.</p>

<p><img src="images/hp3.png"><br>
Figure 6. The color gamut of a sample monitor (an HP A1097C)</p>

<h2>Perceptual Color Space</h2>

<p>CIE XYZ is the fundamental system for color <i>measurement</i>,
but (like RGB space) it is not <i>perceptually uniform</i>.  That is, the
geometric distance apart of two colors does not relate to how different
those colors appear.  However, in 1976 the CIE came up with a
transformation of CIE XYZ space that is (fairly) uniform.  This is CIE
LUV space, which will be used in the next section.</p>

<p>The L parameter stands for lightness.  A gray scale with even
numerical steps along the L axis will look even, and a mid gray will be
at exactly the middle of the L axis.  It is easier to think of the other
two axes in terms of polar coordinates.  The further a color is from
the central L axis, the more saturated it is.  The angle round from the
positive U axis relates to hue.</p>

<p>And, in summary, if we plot a series of colors in CIE LUV color
space, we can tell how evenly spaced those colors are from each other.</p>


<h2>Color Allocation Strategies</h2>

<h3>How many colors?</h3>

<p>Graphical workstations and high-end personal computers are generally
equiped with 24 bit <i>truecolor</i> displays--pixels can
independently be set to any desired color.  8 bits (256 levels) of
red, green, and blue are available giving 16.7 million displayable
colors.  This is enough to eliminate most banding except for large,
slowly varying dark areas, or when gamma correction is done by lookup
table.  Higher quality systems use 10 or 12 bits per pixel, which is
enough to eliminate visible banding from all areas of the RGB color
space.  Such systems are capable of displaying multiple high quality
images.</p>

<p>16 bit displays are also typically used in a truecolor mode.  This
gives slightly worse results than <i>indexed</i> mode with single images
containing 256 colors or less, but vastly better results with multiple
images.  A fine compromise between the somewhat inadequate 8 bit
displays and the luxury of 24, 30, or 36 bit displays, they are now
common on current PCs and Macs.</p>

<p>With an 8 bit indexed display, each pixel holds an index into a table
of color cells.  There can be at most 256 distinct colors on screen at
once, although these colors are not fixed and can be set to any desired
color.  This system saves on expensive screen memory and is fine for
non-graphics-intensive tasks such as displaying single images.  It
starts to struggle when multiple images are to be displayed
concurrently, a common situation for a Web browser.  8 bit displays are
common on current X terminals and on older computers.</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Systems with insufficient colors to display multiple arbitrary
images have to <i>allocate</i> a small number of colors, which are then
used to approximately represent the needed colors.  This process is
termed <i>quantization</i>.  A number of strategies have been developed
for this; each has its merits in certain situations, but none is
universally suitable.  <i>Dithering</i>, or trading spatial resolution for an
increase in the apparent number of colors, can be used to mask the
effect of the color shortage. A poor choice of dithering algorithm
can cause objectionable graininess or spotting on an image.</p>


<h3>First Come First Served</h3>

<p>The simplest strategy is to start allocating colors with the first
inline image and continue until you run out; then map all remaining
colors to the nearest of those previously allocated.  This works well
when there is only a single inline image, or multiple images with few
colors (such as hand-drawn icons), or when there are a number of images
with similar colors such as several grayscale images.</p>

<p>This strategy falls down when:</p> 

<ul>
<li>there are several inline images which contain very dissimilar palettes
</li><li>there are inline truecolor images
</li><li>a multithreaded browser streams in several images concurrently
</li></ul>

<p>Symptoms of this scheme breaking down are severe and objectionable
color casts on those images which loaded last.  Early versions of NCSA
Mosaic for X [<a href="#01">1</a>] employed this approach.
The latest versions appear to be using some sort of adaptive palette
management, optimized for those inline images which are currently
visible, although this has problems with rapid scrolling.</p>

<h3>Color cuboid, without gamma correction</h3>

<p>In an attempt to prevent the problems just described, this method
allocates a <i>fixed</i> range of color cells in advance, and then
maps all colors of all images to the nearest allocated color.  The
same color map is used for every HTML page.</p>

<p>In effect, it treats part of the 256 element lookup table as a
truecolor display.  With an even (in RGB space) allocation, colors
from each inline images are speedily mapped to palette colors by
multiplication and masking.  The problem with this approach is that
coverage of the device color space is necessarily sparse.  Six levels
each of red, green, and blue (the maximum that can be used) requires
216 unallocated color cells.</p>

<p>Seen in CIE LUV color space, some clumping of the allocated colors
is evident in Figure 7.  The necessarily sparse sprinkling through the
color gamut is clearly seen.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/luv-666-nogamma-oblique.png"><br>
Figure 7. A 6x6x6 Color Cube Without Gamma Correction</p>

<p>When other concurrent applications are also utilizing the color map,
it frequently happens that 216 unallocated cells are not available.
The cube must be contracted down to a 5x5x5 cube (125 colors) or even a
sparse 4x4x4 (64 colors) cube shown in Figure 8.  Huge gaps can clearly
be seen.  Dark greens, for example, will show severe specking as the
nearest colors, dithered together to approximate the desired hue, will
be very dissimilar.</p>

<p>

<p>A color palette allocated by Netscape 1.1N for X [<a href="#16">16</a>] is shown in Figure 9.  A 6x6x6 cube has
been allocated in this instance.  The cells used by Netscape start with
the four greys at the end of the third row.</p>

<p><img src="images/netscape-6-palette.png"><br>
Figure 9. Sample color palette used by Netscape 1.1N for X</p>


<h3>Color Cuboid, With Gamma Correction</h3>

<p>There are two changes here.  Firstly, the number of shades of green
has been increased, to fill in the large perceptual range from black to
green and from green to white; secondly the colors have been gamma
corrected before being allocated (this assumes the underlying platform
does not provide any hardware gamma correction, which is frequently the
case).  The effect, sen in Figure 10, is to move all the colors up the
lightness axis. Compare this with Figure 7.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/luv-484-gamma-oblique.png"><br>
Figure 10. A 4x8x4 color cuboid with gamma correction</p>

<p>This plot shows a more even color distribution, although with a
slight lack of the darker colors.  In practice, ambient lighting, glare,
electron scattering and similar factors increase the lightness of
the darkest visible color, making this less noticeable.</p>

<p>Because of the different interval between adjacent green intensities
<!-- feel free to substiture real fraction for these -->
(1/7th of the range) compared to red and blue (1/3rd the range), at no
point within this cuboid is there a color with equal red, green and blue
values (apart from black and white).  Thus, there are no grays.</p>

<p>The human eye is particularly sensitive to small changes in gray
colors, steps in intensity, or deviations in hue from a pure gray.  So
as it stands the cuboid in would give especially bad display of
grayscale images.  The addition of a 16-element grayscale ramp to the
scheme in Figure 11 attends to this shortfall.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/luv-48416-gamma-oblique.png"><br>
Figure 11. A 4x8x4 color cuboid plus 16-element grey ramp, with 
gamma correction</p>

<p>This sort of scheme is used by current versions of Arena [<a href="#17">17</a>] (0.96s and 0.97g) as the typical
colormap in Figure 12 shows.  The cells used by Arena start with the
four grays at the end of the third row and finish at the end of the
third last row.  Notice that the gray ramp is allocated <i>first</i>.
In conditions of severe color shortage, at least the grey ramp will
have been allocated and Arena proceeds to convert all color inline
images to grayscale, preserving much of the graphical information and
providing a pleasing appearance.</p>

<h2>Improved Allocation Schemes</h2>

<p>It would be possible to allocate a range of colors chosen to be
evenly spaced in CIE LUV space, to minimize objectionable spotting when
images are dithered.  There would be no simple relationship between the
image colors and the allocated colors (as there is with a cuboid
scheme) so the image would have to be quantized to the new palette.
Quantization is a slightly more time-consuming process than simple
truncation or masking, and would make a browser feel slightly more
sluggish.</p>

<p>Quantizing to a known fixed palette can be done as the image streams
in.  Image formats which include popularity-sorted suggested palettes,
such as PNG, can also be quantised as they stream in.  If the palette is
not fixed, and the image provides no hints, quantization cannot proceed
until all the images have been loaded. </p>

<p>Another possible improvement would be to requantize all the inline
images to an optimal adaptive palette, <i>after</i> they have all been
loaded and displayed.  This might be presented to the user as an
<tt>optimise this page</tt> option, or a user agent might take advantage
of idle CPU time while the user is reading and scrolling, to perform the
quantization.  The visual effect would be similar to the sharpening
observed with interlaced GIF and PNG and progressive JPEG.  This would
require storage of the un-quantized images, which many user agents
already do as a local caching optimization </p>

<p>Some images with a limited number of colors, such as hand drawn
icons with large areas of flat color, do not necessarily require good
color fidelity.  The speckling introduced by trying to simulate the
desired color may be more objectionable than a change in hue.  Smart
user agents might detect such images--perhaps ones with 32 or less
colors--and disable their dithering on a case by case basis.</p>



<h2>Truecolor Displays</h2> 

<p>Moving from an 8 bit indexed scheme to a 16 bit true color scheme
results in a marked improvement in color fidelity.  Figure 13 shows a
typical scheme with 5 bits for red and blue, 6 bits for green.  (Note
that this implies that a pure grey ramp is not produced, only an
approximation, though the deviations are small.)  The full range of the
color gamut is densely occupied by the 65 thousand color points in
this diagram, even though the size of each colored sphere has been
reduced to a third of that used in the other diagrams.</p>

<h2>Notes to Implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>User agents that use fixed color allocation and support binary
transparency may have problems if their background color cannot be exactly
represented.</p>

<p>Implementation of full transparency, or binary
transparency with background textures, requires large numbers of colors
even if the original image contains few colors.</p>

<p>Resampling (resizing) a limited color image by any method other than
pixel replication will increase the number of colors needed for the
resized image.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>User agents forced to use displays with inadequate colors cannot
really display arbitrary multiple graphics with any sort of fidelity,
regardless of how evenly spaced the colors are.  While some
improvement can be made by allocating a perceptually even set of
colors, this is counterbalanced by slower image display as all 
images are quantized. Thus, attempting to allocate a small fixed
palette which is perceptually even is probably not worth the effort
unless the underlying platform has a powerful CPU.</p>

<p>In conditions of profound color shortage, presenting all images to
greyscale preserves the most detail and looks far better than attempting
to quantize to 27 or less colors.  Ensuring that grayscale data can be
adequately represented at all times is also a sound policy.</p>

<p>The increasing availability of inexpensive truecolor displays should
ease (and in time, eliminate) these problems.  Truecolor displays are
the prerequisite for further advances in accurate image
reproduction.</p>


<h2>Portable Color Graphics</h2>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>We have <a href="#different">already seen</a> that the same
RGB image will display with different colors on two different monitors.
To some extent this is unavoidable as some colors at the edges of one
gamut are outside the other monitor's gamut, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Manufacturers currently take a great deal of care to ensure that
certain colors, for example those associated with a particular brand or
with a corporate logo, are reproduced precisely in printed media.  It is
only a matter of time before they demand a similar fidelity from online
media.</p>

<p>In some cases, we <i>could</i> produce a more accurate color
rendering, but we would need to know the CIE XYZ values of the monitor
on which the <i>original</i> image was generated.  In most cases, we
do not know this.</p>

<p>By analogy with gamma, if this information was stored in the image
file then a start could be made with increasing the color fidelity.
There are currently three image formats that hold such information.  One
is Kodak PhotoCD [<a href="#10">10</a>], another is extended
TIFF, and the third is PNG.</p>

<h3>Accurate Color</h3>

<p>Knowing the CIE XYZ values of the current system monitor and (from
the image) of the originating monitor, a color transform for accurate
display may be computed and applied to an image at minimal computational
cost.  In some cases, color management functions may be provided by the
underlying platform.</p>

<h3>Accurate Gray Scales</h3>

<p>Knowing chromaticity data of the originating monitor it is trivial to
compute the correct color to grayscale transformation.  This gives
<i>noticeably</i> superior results, even on an 8 bit indexed display,
to the oft-quoted formula <i>Gray = 0.30R + 0.59G + 0.11B</i>
which is only correct for the NTSC broadcast monitor, greatly atypical
of modern computer monitors.</p>

<h3>Better Color Printing</h3>

<p>Whenever people acquire a color printer they are initially
delighted, but typically soon become disillusioned as the quality of
output falls far short of their expectations--a color magazine, for
example.  While accurate screen-to-print color matching is still not a
fully automated process, advances have been made in recent years
and modern printers with a Level 2 PostScript interpreter can take
calibrated RGB data and do a better job of matching the on-screen
colors than with raw RGB data.</p>


<h3>But What of the Future?</h3>

<p>More advanced methods of generating accurate portable color have
been proposed, such as the International Color Consortium Profile [<a href="#18">18</a>]. A legitimate concern is whether these
more complex methods will supersede the methods discussed in this paper.
The answer is that they may well do, but as all such approaches are
built upon the foundation, directly or indirectly, of the CIE XYZ color
space, the simpler approaches are headed in the right direction and
offer a smooth upgrade path.</p>


<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>Attempting to produce better colors for screen display or for
printing assumes that simpler issues such as the gamma correction are 
being handled correctly and that a truecolor display is available.

</p><h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Accurate device independent color reproduction has been spreading
from high-end pre-press applications into the mainstream for the last
five years or so.  Web user agents which are able to make use of
chromaticity information will be at an increasing market advantage in
the years to come.</p>


<h2>Embedded Metadata</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>The topic of metadata has received some attention in connection with
textual data.  Graphics too can have important metadata, such as
Copyright details, descriptions of the content of the image, legal
disclaimers, or technical descriptions of the method of image synthesis
employed.  More application-specific metadata could include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The hospital number of a patient (for MRI or CT medical images)

</li><li>The accession number (for images of museum holdings)

</li><li>Dataset, algorithms used and parameter settings (for scientific
visualization results)

</li><li>The artist name and the asking price (for a fine-art
catalogue)
</li></ul>

<p>and so on.  This information needs to be associated with the
graphical information in some way.  As images become used as more than
mere adornment, the role of image metadata will grow.  Quality graphics
have associated metadata.</p>


<h3>To Embed or Not to Embed</h3>

<p>The traditional method of transmitting such information has been via
a separate text file.  There is however the risk that the two files will
become separated.  Metadata can also be supplied as an HTML file, with
the image linked to or supplied inline, to make a stronger connection
between the image and its metadata.</p>

<p>These methods have consistency problems--particularly in a caching
proxy environment--when either the image or the metadata needs to be
altered.</p>

<p>Rather than embedding the image in the metadata, several image
formats allow text of various kinds to be contained within an image.
The advantage of this is that the metadata cannot be inadvertently
separated, and hence for example the copyright details of a graphic are
unambiguous.  Keeping the information in a single file also permits the
use of message digests (as proposed in the draft HTML 3.0 specification
[<a href="#19">19</a>]) on link anchors, to ensure that the
currently linked-to graphic is exactly what the document author intended
to link to with that URL.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of embedded metadata is that the Web user agent must
extract the information and display it.  The means of doing so are
necessarily different for each Internet Media type.  It is a trade off
between inconvenience to the implementor and the convenience to the user
of a single consistent user interface.  This has to date been one of the
Web's strengths, and a browser which presented embedded metadata by
generating an HTML page would be highly suited to applications where
image quality was considered important.</p>

<p>A third, compromise possibility would be to link to a multipart
Internet Media type containing image data and an accompanying metadata
file.  There is as yet little experience, however, with the
presentational aspects of multipart objects.</p>


<h2>Notes to Implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>There are no known interactions between providing this facility and
any other aspects of graphical excellence.  </p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Providing the ability to directly view embedded metadata in graphics
files for a small number of suitable Internet Media types associated
with high quality graphics would be an interesting experiment.  PNG is a
relatively simple format which provides for text chunks with associated
keywords, and the coded character set for these chunks is ISO Latin-1.
There is a freely available C library for reading and writing PNG files,
including extraction of text chunks.  It would thus be a suitable
candidate for trial implementation of this facility.</p>


<h2><a name="end">Conclusions</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to provide high quality graphics on the Web if due
consideration is given to the appropriate factors.  This need not result
in reduced interactive performance if care is taken.  Inappropriate
choices result in severely suboptimal graphics which users are quick to
see and complain about;  bad graphics are very visible.  There is
increasing demand for high quality graphics.  User agents that take note
of this trend will have a market advantage.  </p>
