<h1>Colour display</h1>

<p>A quick spot of colour theory before we can <a
href="gq-alloc.html">move on</a>.  The bare minimum, really!  (<a
href="#fncol">1</a>)</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>The colour of an object depends not only on the precise spectrum of
light emitted or reflected from it but also on the observer - their
species, what else they can see, even what they have recently looked
at! Colour is not an objective property of real-world objects; it is a 
subjective, biological sensation.</p>


<h2>So what is colour, anyway</h2>

<p>Given the preceeding description of colour sensation, one might be
forgiven for assuming that there is no way to cope with these
vagarities.  However, by treating the entire human eye/brain system as a
black box and performing colour matching experiments upon it, it has
been possible to arrive at a surprisingly objective, measurable and
repeatable <em>model</em> of colour that corresponds in large measure
with how we see colour.  This system, invented and standardised in the
1930s by the International Commission on Lighting (Commission
Internationale de l'clairage, or CIE) [<a href="gq-refs.html#14">14</a>]
is called CIE XYZ [<a href="gq-refs.html#15">15</a>] and is capable of
representing all colours that can be seen by the human visual system.
The XYZ value of a colour can be measured by physical instruments or
calculated from the spectrum of light given off by an object.</p>

<p><a name="different">When</a> we look at an image on a computer
screen, what we see depends on the precise colour and intensity of light
emitted by each of the three phosphors in a computer monitor; this in
turn depends on the make and the model, plus less tangible factors (such
as the age, blue phosphors degrade faster than the other two).  In the
limit, each monitor is unique.  This means that the same R,G,B values
applied to two different monitors will give different colours;
similarly, to produce exactly the same colour on two different monitors,
different R,G,B values must be applied.</p>

<h2>Gamut</h2>

<p>Provided the CIE XYZ measured colours of the red, green and blue
phosphors are available for a particular monitor, any RGB colour on that
monitor can be converted to CIE XYZ.  Similarly, any measured CIE XYZ
colour can be reproduced on that monitor, provided it falls within the
range of displayable colours - the <i>gamut</i> - bounded by the
monitor primaries.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the triangular gamut of one particular monitor, drawn
on a chromaticity diagram.  This is a way of reducing the three
dimensional CIE XYZ space to two dimensions by removing the brightness
information (light orange and dark orange map the the same
chromaticities).  Different monitors will have different gamuts.</p>

<h2>Perceptual colour space</h2>

<p>CIE XYZ is the fundamental system for colour <em>measurement</em>,
but (like RGB space) it is not <i>perceptually uniform</i>.  That is, the
geometric distance apart of two colours does not relate to how different
those colours appear.  However, in 1976 the CIE came up with a
transformation of CIE XYZ space that is (fairly) uniform.  This is CIE
LUV space, which will be used in the next section.</p>

<p>The L parameter stands for lightness.  A grey scale with even
numerical steps along the L axis will look even, and a mid grey will be
at exactly the middle of the L axis.  It is easier to think of the other
two axes in terms of polar coordinates.  The further a colour is from
the central L axis, the more saturated it is.  The angle round from the
positive U axis relates to hue.</p>

<p>And, in summary, if we plot a series of colours in CIE LUV colour
space, we can tell how evenly spaced those colours are from each other.
Which we are about to do.</p>
