Not Just Decoration: Quality Graphics for the Web</a></h3>
<hr>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The means of providing and using high quality textual information on
the Web has received a great deal of attention.  Of course, there is
still plenty of low-grade textual information out there.  But the
requirements are well understood and the infrastructure is in place for
those who wish to generate or use quality text.</p>

<p>Much graphical material on the Web is also of poor quality, but in
contrast the requirements for high quality graphics on the Web have
received much less attention.  Granted, many graphics are mere
adornment, but some are not.  Graphics can be valid information in their
own right.</p>

<p>It would also be dangerous and limiting to assume that browsing
constitutes the totality of present and future Web use.  In some
applications, the graphical component can be essential.  Thus, it makes
sense to evaluate the particular requirements for quality Web
graphics.</p>

<h2>Application areas</h2>

<p>A sample of existing and potential application areas dependent on high
quality images:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inline graphics were first added to the web because they were needed
for a distributed, collaborative <em>scientific visualisation</em> application.
Thus, NCSA Mosaic [<a href="gq-refs.html#01">1</a>] was born.  Scientific
visualisation remains an application where high quality graphics are an
essential requirement and where graphics constitute the bulk of the
information.

<li>Commercial applications such as <em>product design</em> and collaborative
evaluation of prototypes clearly benefit from using the Web, and also
require a high level of colour fidelity in rendition of images.

<li>In the <em>medical</em> and <em>veterinary</em> fields, clear and portable images are
essential if clinical decisions are to be made using them; there is also
the need for tightly coupled image metadata for safety and liability
reasons.

<li>Accurate, repeatable device independent colour representation is an
emerging key requirement in <em>advertising</em>.  Extreme care is currently
taken with printed materials to ensure consistent colours for such
things as brand identification and corporate identity, but the
infrastructure is only slowly being put in place to assure a similar
level of fidelity on the Web.

<li>Last but not least, computer graphics research has a clear need for
the dissemination of accurate images for viewing and analysis by
colleagues worldwide.
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2> 

<p>This paper will survey some major areas affecting 2 dimensional,
static, raster graphics quality.  Vector graphics (such as CGM), 3
dimensional graphics (such as VRML), animations and movies are not
considered.</p>

<p>It will focus on areas such as accurate colour and tonal rendition
which may as yet be unfamiliar to developers of Web user agents.  Topics
which are important for Web graphics in general, but do not strictly
relate to graphics <em>quality</em> - such as compression efficiency -
are also outside the scope of this paper.</p>

<h2>Effect on Web user agents</h2>

<p>Computer Graphics can be seen as a somewhat specialised area -
particularly where accurate rendition is required.  Yet parts of it need
to be understood to produce good graphics.  Experience has shown that
users can be harshly critical of browsers with poor image quality, even
if these same browsers excel in other areas.  The thrust of this paper
is to pull together separate strands of computer graphics as they relate
to Web user agents, to make it easier to provide the increasingly high
levels of graphical quality that users are demanding.</p>


<p>A number of different quality requirements are discussed in this
paper.  Attempting to implement a single one of these in isolation can
be difficult, as there are strong interactions between them.  Partial
implementation still requires an awareness of the other factors.  This
paper highlights known interdependencies to make the implementors job
easier and  prevent nasty surprises.</p>
