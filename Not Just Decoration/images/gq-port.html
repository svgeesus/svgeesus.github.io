<h1>Portable colour graphics</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>We have <a href="gq-gamut#different">already seen</a> that the same
RGB image will display with different colours on two different monitors.
To some extent this is unavoidable as some colours at the edges of one
gamut are outside the other monitor's gamut, and vice verca.</p>

<p>Manufacturers currently take great deal of care to ensure that
certain colours, for example those associated with a particular brand or
with a corporate logo, are reproduced precisely in printed media.  It is
only a matter of time before they demand a similar fidelity from online
media.</p>

<p>In some cases, we <em>could</em> produce a more accurate colour
rendering, but we would need to know the CIE XYZ values of the monitor
on which the <em>original</em> image was generated.  In most cases, we
do not know this.</p>

<p>By analogy with gamma, if this information was stored in the image
file then a start could be made with increasing the colour fidelity.
There are currently three image formats that hold such information.  One
is Kodak PhotoCD [<a href="gq-refs.html#10">10</a>], another is extended
TIFF, and the third is PNG.</p>

<h2>Accurate colour</h2>

<p>Knowing the CIE XYZ values of the current system monitor and (from
the image) of the originating monitor, a colour transform for accurate
display may be computed and applied to an image at minimal computational
cost.  In some cases, colour management functions may be provided by the
underlying platform.</p>

<h2>Accurate grey scales</h2>

<p>Knowing chromaticity data of the originating monitor it is trivial to
compute the correct colour to greyscale transformation.  This gives
<em>noticeably</em> superior results, even on an 8 bit indexed display,
to the oft-quoted formula <cite>Grey = 0.30R + 0.59G + 0.11B</cite>
which is only correct for the NTSC broadcast monitor, greatly atypical
of modern computer monitors.</p>

<h2>Better colour printing</h2>

<p>Whenever people acquire a colour printer they are initially
delighted, but typically soon become disillusioned as the quality of
output falls far short of their expectations - a colour magazine, for
example.  While accurate screen-to-print colour matching is still not a
fully automated process, advances have been made in recent years
and modern printers with a Level 2 PostScript interpreter can take
calibrated RGB data and do a better job of matching the on-screen
colours than with raw RGB data.</p>


<h2>But what of the future?</h2>

<p>More advanced methods of generating accurate portable colour have
been proposed, such as the International Color Consortium Profile [<a
href="gq-refs.html#18">18</a>]. A legitimate concern is whether these
more complex methods will supercede the methods discussed in this paper.
The answer is that they may well do, but as all such approaches are
built upon the foundation, directly or indirectly,of the CIE XYZ colour
space, the simpler approaches are headed in the right direction and
offer a smooth upgrade path.</p>

<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>Attempting to produce better colours for screen display or for
printing assumes that simpler issues such as the gamma correction are 
being handled correctly and that a truecolour display is available.

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Accurate device independent colour reproduction has been spreading
from high-end pre-press applications into the mainstream for the last
five years or so.  Web user agents which are able to make use of
chromaticity information will be at an increasing market advantage in
the years to come.</p>
