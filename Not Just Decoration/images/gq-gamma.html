<h1>Gamma correction</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>When expressing a colour in RGB, what we are trying to specify is the
amount of light which will be emitted from each phosphor, as a fraction
of full power.  What we are <em>actually</em> specifying is however the
voltage which will be applied to each electron gun.</p>

<p> The two are not linearly related, because the amount of light
emitted is proportional to the beam power rather than the voltage.  The
beam power is the product of voltage and current, and current turns out
to be roughly proportional to the grid voltage to the power 1.5.  Thus,
the light emitted is proportional to the voltage to the power 2.5 or so.
The actual value of the exponent, called <i>gamma</i>, varies somewhat
and the power law is only an an approximate model of the real situation,
albeit a good one.  An additional optical effect caused by viewing
images against a dim surround is that the effective gamma value is
somewhat reduced, from a theoretical 2.5 to around 2.2</p>

<!--   Oh for some real equations! Roll on the incorporation of 
       HTML 3.0 maths into HTML 2.x he said wistfully            -->

<p>To deal with this non-linearity, the inverse power function (1/2.2)
is applied to the RGB data before display, compensating for the
non-linearities which will be introduced.  Figure 5 shows a typical
correction curve, which is a mirror image about the line <tt>Input =
Output</tt> of the display non-linearity.  (In other words, the display
non-linearity curves down from a straight line and so the gamma
correction curves up from that line [<a href="gq-refs.html#08">8</a>].

<p>There are a number of places at which this correction could be
applied, and this affects how Web user agents handle image data.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the image data itself, in other words a correction has been
applied at the server end.

<li>In the user agent software, correction being applied as the image is
streamed in.

<li>In the software of the underlying platform.  The Apple Mac and SGI
workstations are examples of systems which apply some correction at this
stage, using corrections of 1/1.4 and 1/1.7 (by default)
respectively. (Put another way, the remaining correction that needs 
to be applied is 1.78 and 1.47 respectively)

<li>In the hardware of the underlying platform, using
variable attenuation or amplification.  The Barco Calibrator is an
example of a monitor which performs correction at this stage, using
test signals and measured luminance values to correct itself.
</ol>

<p>The end result of all these potential corrections, plus the display
non-linearity, must equal a linear transformation for accurate tonal
reproduction to be obtained.  The Web user agent must therefore be aware
of the amount of correction from step one (in the image file received
from the server) and from steps two and three (provided by the
underlying platform) so that the appropriate correction can be made.

<h2>Avoiding guesswork</h2>

<p>With most image formats there is no way to determine if any
correction has been applied at step one, and if so, what value was used.
This results in considerable uncertainty among information providers as
to how to proceed.  The <a href =
"http://www.halcyon.com/coolbrz/psycho.html"> following quote</a> is
typical:</p>

<blockquote>We have no real stats on what people on the nets have and
what looks best.  Most Mac's wash out the colors while Windows 3.1 make
everything look dark.  We need to know what is the best approach to
providing free graphics.  Please let us know what you want!</blockquote>

<p>What is needed is for the image file to contain machine-readable
details of the correction that has been applied.  This facility has been
part of the Utah RLE format [<a href="gq-refs.html#09">9</a>] for
several years.  TIFF files [<a href="gq-refs.html#05">5</a>]
<em>can</em> contain very precise transfer curves although most in
practice do not.  PNG [<a href="gq-refs.html#06">6</a>]also has the
facility to record any gamma correction that has been applied.  Kodak
PhotoCD [<a href="gq-refs.html#10">10</a>] uses a single standard
transfer function.  Clearly, such formats make the user agent
implementor's job much easier.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>
<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>If an image is under or over gamma corrected, this also affects the
colour balance.  Over correction (in addition to making mid-tones too
light) shifts colours towards neutral grey, while under correction (in
addition to making mid-tones too dark) shifts colours towards the
display primaries.</p>

<p>Viewing on screen and printing on paper are two process with very
different transfer characteristics, so what is right for one is not
right for the other.  The extent of the mismatch depends on how much of
the required correction has already been done to the image, how much is
done in the viewing software, and how much (if any) is done by the
software or hardware of the underlying platform.</p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>User agents should provide some sort of gamma correction which does
the right thing in as many cases as possible.  This might be done
by, in order of importance:</p>

<ul>

<li>Honouring explicit source gamma declarations in those image files
that support them - currently TIFF, Utah RLE and PNG.  Encouraging use
of such formats to avoid guesswork.

<li>Providing well chosen default settings, appropriate to the
underlying platform.

<li>Using suitable heuristics based on the Internet Media type for image
formats without explicit source gamma declarations.  For example, GIF
images typically have a source gamma of 0.45 (<i>ie</i> they are already
corrected, for most displays) while JPEG JFIF [<a
href="gq-refs.html#11">11</a>] files often have a source gamma of 1.0
(<i>ie</i> they are uncorrected).  Yes, this is a guess.  It <em>will</em>
sometimes be wrong.  It is however an improvement on providing no gamma
correction at all, or a blanket gamma correction on all types of images.

<li>Allowing setting of gamma in the preferences, for example by
providing a slider to adjust the screen gamma by eye, for example until
a user-agent-generated tone reproduction chart looks correct on screen,
and saving this value for future use.

<li>Allowing customisation by knowledgable users or those with stringent
requirements, for example by inputting measured transfer characteristics
or providing an interface for external programs to be called to aid in
accurate reproduction.</ul>

<p>User agents which offer printing should be aware of the different
gamma requirements for screen and print and might offer similar
facilities (allowing customisation, printing a test chart) to adjust
gamma for printing.</p>
