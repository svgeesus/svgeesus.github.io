<h1>Colour allocation strategies</h1>

<h2>How many colours?</h2>

<p>Graphical workstations and high-end personal computers are generally
equiped with 24 bit <i>truecolour</i> displays - pixels can
independently be set to any desired colour.  8 bits (256 levels) of
red, green, and blue are available giving 16.7 million displayable
colours.  This is enough to eliminate most banding except for large,
slowly varying dark areas, or when gamma correction is done by lookup
table.  Higher quality systems use 10 or 12 bits per pixel, which is
enough to eliminate visible banding from all areas of the RGB colour
space.  Such systems are capable of displaying multiple high quality
images.</p>

<p>16 bit displays are also typically used in a truecolour mode.  This
gives slightly worse results than <i>indexed</i> mode with single images
containing 256 colours or less, but vastly better results with multiple
images.  A fine compromise between the somewhat inadequate 8 bit
displays and the luxury of 24, 30 or 36 bit displays, they are now
common on current PCs and Macs.</p>

<p>With an 8 bit indexed display, each pixel holds an index into a table
of colour cells.  There can be at most 256 distinct colours on screen at
once, although these colours are not fixed and can be set to any desired
colour.  This system saves on expensive screen memory and is fine for
non graphics-intensive tasks such as displaying single images.  It
starts to struggle when multiple images are to be displayed
concurrently, a common situation for a Web browser.  8 bit displays are
common on current X terminals and on older computers.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Systems with insufficient colours to display multiple arbitrary
images have to <i>allocate</i> a small number of colours, which are then
used to approximately represent the needed colours.  This process is
termed <i>quantisation</i>.  A number of strategies have been developed
for this; each has it's merits in certain situations, but none is
universally suitable.  <i>Dithering</i>, or trading spatial resolution for an
increase in the apparent number of colours, can be used to mask the
effect of the colour shortage. A poor choice of dithering algorithm
can cause objectionable graininess or spotting on an image.</p>

<hr>
<h2>First come first served</h2>

<p>The simplest strategy is to start allocating colours with the first
inline image and continue until you run out; then map all remaining
colours to the nearest of those previously allocated.  This works well
when there is only a single inline image, or multiple images with few
colours (such as hand-drawn icons), or when there are a number of images
with similar colours such as several greyscale images.</p>

<p>This strategy falls down when:</p> 

<ul>
<li>there are several inline images which contain very dissimilar palettes
<li>there are inline truecolour images
<li>a multi-threaded browser streams in several images concurrently
</ul>

<p>Symptoms of this scheme breaking down are severe and objectionable
colour casts on those images which loaded last.  Early versions of NCSA
Mosaic for X [<a href="gq-refs.html#01">1</a>] employed this approach.
The latest versions appear to be using some sort of adaptive palette
management, optimised for those inline images which are currently
visible, although this has problems with rapid scrolling.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Colour cuboid, without gamma correction</h2>

<p>In an attempt to prevent the problems just described, this method
allocates a <em>fixed</em> range of colour cells in advance, and then
maps all colours of all images to the nearest allocated colour.  The
same colour map is used for every HTML page.</p>

<p>In effect, it treats part of the 256 element lookup table as a
truecolour display.  With an even (in RGB space) allocation, colours
from each inline images are speedily mapped to palette colours by
multiplication and masking.  The problem with this approach is that
coverage of the device colour space is necessarily sparse.  Six levels
of each of red, green and blue (the maximum that can be used) requires
216 un-allocated colour cells.</p>

<p>Seen in CIE LUV colour space, some clumping of the allocated colours
is evident in Figure 7.  The necessarily sparse sprinkling through the
colour gamut is clearly seen.</p>

<i>Figure 7: A 6x6x6 colour cube without gamma correction.</i></p>

<p>When other concurrent applications are also utilising the colour map,
it frequently happens that 216 un-allocated cells are not available.
The cube must be contracted down to a 5x5x5 cube (125 colours) or even a
sparse 4x4x4 (64 colours) cube shown in Figure 8.  Huge gaps can clearly
be seen.  Dark greens, for example, will show severe specking as the
nearest colours, dithered together to approximate the desired hue, will
be very dissimilar.</p>

<p>A colour palette allocated by Netscape 1.1N for X [<a
href="gq-refs.html#16">16</a>] is shown in Figure 9.  A 6x6x6 cube has
been allocated in this instance.  The cells used by Netscape start with
the four greys at the end of the third row.</p>

<h2>Colour cuboid, with gamma correction</h2>

<p>There are two changes here.  Firstly, the number of shades of green
has been increased, to fill in the large perceptual range from black to
green and from green to white; secondly the colours have been gamma
corrected before being allocated (this assumes the underlying platform
does not provide any hardware gamma correction, which is frequently the
case).  The effect, sen in Figure 10, is to move all the colours up the
lightness axis. Compare this with Figure 7.</p>

<p><a href="luv-484-gamma-oblique.png">
<img src="luv-484-gamma-oblique-small.jpg"></a><br>
<i>Fig 10: A 4x8x4 colour cuboid with gamma correction.</i></p>

<p>This plot shows a more even colour distribution, although with a
slight lack of the darker colours.  In practice, ambient lighting, glare,
electron scattering and similar factors increase the lightness of
the darkest visible colour, making this less noticeable.</p>

<p>Because of the different interval between adjacent green intensities
<!-- feel free to substiture real fraction for these -->
(1/7th of the range) compared to red and blue (1/3rd the range), at no
point within this cuboid is there a colour with equal red, green and blue
values (apart from black and white).  Thus, there are no greys.</p>

<p>The human eye is particularly sensitive to small changes in grey
colours; steps in intensity, or deviations in hue from a pure grey.  So
as it stands the cuboid in would give especially bad display of
greyscale images.  The addition of a 16-element greyscale ramp to the
scheme in Figure 11 attends to this shortfall.</p>

<i>Fig 11: A 4x8x4 colour cuboid plus 16-element grey ramp, with 
gamma correction.</i></p>

<p>This sort of scheme is used by current versions of Arena [<a
href="gq-refs.html#17">17</a>] (0.96s and 0.97g) as the typical
colourmap in Figure 12 shows.  The cells used by Arena start with the
four greys at the end of the third row and finish at the end of the
third last row.  Notice that the grey ramp is allocated <em>first</em>.
In conditions of severe colour shortage, at least the grey ramp will
have been allocated and Arena proceeds to convert all colour inline
images to greyscale, preserving much of the graphical information and
providing a pleasing apearance.</p>

<h2>Improved allocation schemes</h2>

<p>It would be possible to allocate a range of colours chosen to be
evenly spaced in CIE LUV space, to minimise objectionable spotting when
images are dithered.  There would be no simple relationship between the
image colours and the allocated colours (as there is with a cuboid
scheme) so the image would have to be quantised to the new palette.
Quantisation is a slightly more time-consuming process than simple
truncation or masking, and would make a browser feel slightly more
sluggish.</p>

<p>Quantising to a known fixed palette can be done as the image streams
in.  Image formats which include popularity-sorted suggested palettes,
such as PNG, can also be quantised as they stream in.  If the palette is
not fixed, and the image provides no hints, quantisation cannot proceed
until all the images have been loaded. </p>

<p>Another possible improvement would be to re-quantise all the inline
images to an optimal adaptive palette, <em>after</em> they have all been
loaded and displayed.  This might be presented to the user as an
<tt>optimise this page</tt> option, or a user agent might take advantage
of idle CPU time while the user is reading and scrolling, to perform the
quantisation.  The visual effect would be similar to the sharpening
observed with interlaced GIF and PNG and progressive JPEG.  This would
require storage of the un-quantised images, which many user agents
already do as a local cacheing optimisation </p>

<p>Some images with a limited number of colours, such as hand drawn
icons with large areas of flat colour, do not necessarily require good
colour fidelity.  The speckling introduced by trying to simulate the
desired colour may be more objectionable than a change in hue.  Smart
user agents might detect such images - perhaps ones with 32 or less
colours - and disable their dithering on a case by case basis.</p>


<hr> 

<h2>Truecolour displays</h2> 

<p>Moving from an 8 bit indexed scheme to a 16 bit true colour scheme
results in a marked improvement in colour fidelity.  Figure 13 shows a
typical scheme with 5 bits for red and blue, 6 bits for green.  (Note
that this implies that a pure grey ramp is not produced, only an
approximation, though the deviations are small.)  The full range of the
colour gamut is densely occupied by the 65 thousand colour points in
this diagram, even though the size of each coloured sphere has been
reduced to a third of that used in the other diagrams.</p>

<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>User agents that use fixed colour allocation and support binary
transparency may have problems if their background colour cannot be exactly
represented.</p>

<p>Implementation of full transparency, or binary
transparency with background textures, requires large numbers of colours
even if the original image contains few colours.</p>

<p>Resampling (resizing) a limited colour image by any method other than
pixel replication will increase the number of colours needed for the
resized image.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>User agents forced to use displays with inadequate colours cannot
really display arbitrary multiple graphics with any sort of fidelity,
regardless of how evenly spaced the colours are.  Whilst some
improvement can be made by allocating a perceptually even set of
colours, this is counterbalanced by slower image display as all 
images are quantised. Thus, attempting to allocate a small fixed
palette which is perceptually even is probably not worth the effort
unless the underlying platform has a powerful CPU.</p>

<p>In conditions of profound colour shortage, presenting all images to
greyscale preserves the most detail and looks far better than attempting
to quantise to 27 or less colours.  Ensuring that greyscale data can be
adequately represented at all times is also a sound policy.</p>

<p>The increasing availability of inexpensive truecolour displays should
ease (and in time, eliminate) these problems.  Truecolour displays are
the prerequisite for further advances in accurate image
reproduction.</p>
