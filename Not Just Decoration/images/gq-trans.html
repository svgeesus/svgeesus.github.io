<h1>Anti-aliasing and Transparency</h1>

<h2>What is aliasing</h2>

<p>Aliasing is an artefact caused by inadequate sampling frequency
(<a href="#alias">1</a>).  The term is most commonly applied to
spatial aliasing, which manifests as visible pixelation - a blocky or
jagged effect - especially with near horizontal or near vertical lines
of high contrast.  It is thus particularly noticed with textual
annotation of images.  Figure 1 shows a sample image, converted from a
PostScript file with one sample per pixel, that displays severe spatial
aliasing.</p>

<i>Figure 1: A severely aliased image.</i></p>

<h2>How is aliasing reduced</h2>

<p>Aliasing may be reduced by taking multiple samples of the underlying
information.  In the case of a computer graphics technique such as
raytracing, this involves shooting multiple rays through different parts
of each pixel.  In the case of PostScript conversion to images, this is
achieved by rasterising at a higher resolution then resampling down to
the intended resolution.  Figure 2 shows the same PostScript file
rendered with 16 samples per pixel.  Much less aliasing is seen.
Careful examination of the edges of lettering and the coloured blocks
shows that the background and foreground colours have been blended together based on their sub-pixel coverage.</p>

<h2>What is transparency</h2>

<p>Image file formats that support transparency are able to make certain
designated pixels wholly or partially transparent, so that the
background colour or texture shows through.  In this way,
non-rectangular images may be simulated regardless of the background
colour or texture of the user agent, as in seen in Figure 3.</p>

<p><img src="seed-crambin.gif"><br>
<i>Figure 3: An image with binary transparency.</i></p>

<p>The simplest type of transparency is binary - each pixel is either
<em>on</em> or <em>off</em>.  This may be specified by a binary
transparency mask, or (particularly with palette-based formats) by
nominating a particular colour or group of colours to be transparent.
The latter method is used by the GIF89a format [<a href =
"gq-refs.html#04">4</a>] and is widely supported in current Web user
agents.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>There is a <strong>severe interaction</strong> between anti-aliasing
and binary transparency.  Because the background colour of the image is
mixed in with the foreground colours, simply replacing a single
background colour with another is not enough to simulate transparency.
There will be a whole host of shades which are <em>mixtures</em> of
background and foreground colours, as Figure 4 shows.  The effect in
this case is a white halo around objects, because the original image was
anti-aliased to a white background colour.</p>

<i>Figure 4: Halo effect caused by anti-aliased edges.</i></p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>An improvement on binary transparency is variable transparency, also
known as an alpha mask or alpha channel.  Here each pixel can take any
value between fully opaque and fully transparent, and this value is
independent of the colour of that pixel.  Besides allowing smooth
transitions between a graphic and the background, this permits a
different type of antialiasing.</p>

<p>Foreground colours contributing to a particular pixel are mixed
together according to their sub-pixel foreground coverage,
<em>ignoring</em> contribution from the background.  The alpha channel
value is used to express the fractional contribution of the original
background, irrespective of that background's colour.  When rendered,
this alpha channel specifies for each pixel what proportion of the
existing background is to be mixed with the forground image data to
produce the final colour of each pixel.  In this way, the anti-aliased
image can be displayed on any background or texture, or indeed
composited on top of another arbitrary image, without the artefacts seen
with binary transparency.</p>

<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>There has been an increase in the number of anti-aliased images as
people strive for better quality, and this brings to the fore a number
of interations.  That between anti-aliasing and binary transparency has
already been noted.  Also, anti-aliased images contain a lot more
colours than aliased ones, which puts pressure on the <a href=
"gq-alloc.html">colour allocation strategy</a>.</p>

<p>Variable transparency is most easily implemented with a truecolour
display, because if any image pixel may be mixed with the user agent's
background colour or texture in any proportion, the total number of
colours in a displayed image can become quite large.  It can be
implemented in a colour-scarce environment provided an off screen buffer
is provided to composite the image before reducing it to the current
palette.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Future Web user agents should permit as inline images formats that
support variable transparency, to allow quality anti-aliased images that
are independent of the background colour or texture.  Suitable formats
include extended TIFF [<a href="gq-refs.html#05">5</a>] and PNG [<a
href="gq-refs.html#06">6</a>].  This will encourage information
providers to migrate away from formats that only support binary
transparency, such as GIF89a.</p>

<p>This will also allow the OVERLAY attribute of the draft HTML 3.0 FIG
element [<a href="gq-refs.html#07">7</a>] to be deployed more effectively.
Overlays are only of use if one can also see what is being overlaid.</p>
