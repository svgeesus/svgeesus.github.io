Not Just Decoration: quality graphics for the Web</a></h3>

<h1>Embedded metadata</h1>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>The topic of metadata has received some attention in connection with
textual data.  Graphics too can have important metadata, such as
Copyright details, descriptions of the content of the image, legal
disclaimers, or technical descriptions of the method of image synthesis
employed.  More application-specific metadata could include:</p>

<ul>

<li>the hospital number of a patient (for MRI or CT medical images)

<li>the accession number (for images of museum holdings)

<li>dataset, algorithms used and parameter settings (for scientific
visualisation results)

<li>the artist name and the asking price (for a fine-art
catalogue)
</ul>

<p>and so on.  This information needs to be associated with the
graphical information in some way.  As images become used as more than
mere adornment, the role of image metadata will grow.  Quality graphics
have associated metadata.</p>

<hr>
<h2>To embed or not to embed</h2>

<p>The traditional method of transmitting such information has been via
a separate text file.  There is however the risk that the two files will
become separated.  Metadata can also be supplied as an HTML file, with
the image linked to or supplied inline, to make a stronger connection
between the image and it's metadata.</p>

<p>These methods have consistency problems - particularly in a cacheing
proxy environment - when either the image or the metadata needs to be
altered.</p>

<p>Rather than embedding the image in the metadata, several image
formats allow text of various kinds to be contained within an image.
The advantage of this is that the metadata cannot be inadvertantly
separated, and hence for example the copyright details of a graphic are
unambiguous.  Keeping the information in a single file also permits the
use of message digests (as proposed in the draft HTML 3.0 specification
[<a href="gq-refs.html#19">19</a>]) on link anchors, to ensure that the
currently linked-to graphic is exactly what the document author intended
to link to with that URL.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of embedded metadata is that the Web user agent must
extract the information and display it.  The means of doing so are
necessarily different for each Internet Media type.  It is a trade off
between inconvenience to the implementor and the convenience to the user
of a single consistent user interface.  This has to date been one of the
Web's strengths, and a browser which presented embedded metadata by
generating an HTML page would be highly suited to applications where
image quality was considered important.</p>

<p>A third, compromise possibility would be to link to a multipart
Internet Media type containing image data and an accompanying metadata
file.  There is as yet little experience, however, with the
presentational aspects of multipart objects.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Notes to implementors</h2>

<h3>Interactions</h3>

<p>There are no known interactions between providing this facility and
any other aspects of graphical excellence.  </p>


<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Providing the ability to directly view embedded metadata in graphics
files for a small number of suitable Internet Media types associated
with high quality graphics would be an interesting experiment.  PNG is a
relatively simple format which provides for text chunks with associated
keywords, and the coded character set for these chunks is ISO Latin-1.
There is a freely available C library for reading and writing PNG files,
including extraction of text chunks.  It would thus be a suitable
candidate for trial implementation of this facility.</p>
