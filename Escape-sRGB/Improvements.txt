Improvements

Use the better colored chromaticity diagram from my Wiley book, update the gamut diagrams to use that also

Update current browser support to latest versions

Add palette interpolation for color fonts (very new)

DONE add a named color to the 'all srgb' slide and to the sRGB chromaticity scatterplot

DONE introduce chromaticity diagrams, animated? tongue with spectral colors, purple line, mixes on straight lines (additivity). Somewhat perceptually uniform but not very good. BONUS: its in 2D

DONE expand opponent colors, add lightness, develop polar model (OKLab/OKLCH)

DONE add Canvas display-p3 example (from the book) just before mixing section

DONE add gamut mapping sides at end of manipulating section

add another defensive css slide to show guarding for beyond-sRGB gradients

DONE maybe add an oog diagram for mixing in polar color spaces (from spec)

DONE add a closing questions slide, with url of slides and promise of video to come.
