        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Traditional color management,
        with a focus on the reproduction of printed imagery,
        has concerned itself with a restricted dynamic range;
        it is
        constrained by the deepest multi-ink black, on the one hand,
        and paper white
        seen under a not especially bright illuminant
        (2000 lux for critical viewing, per [<a href="#ISO_3664:2009">ISO 3664:2009</a>]
        on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the deepest black in the [<a href="FOGRA51">FOGRA51</a>] characterisation data
            (CMYK 100 100 100 100) has an Lab value of 12.71 0.53 4.89,
            giving a dynamic range of 65.95.

        </p>
        <p>
        For on-screen presentation,
        developments in Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) display technology
        increased this dynamic range,
        but it was still bounded by display flare (at the dark end)
        and modest peak luminances of 200 cd/m² or so at the high end,
        giving a linear dynamic range of 1000:1 or so.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the lowest conformance level
            of the VESA [<a href="#DisplayHDR">DisplayHDR</a>] specification
            gives a minimum luminance for peak white of 400 cd/m²
            and a maximum luminance for black (at maximum scene luminance,
            i.e. no backlight dimming) of 0.4 cd/m²;
            the simultaneous contrast is thus 1000:1.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fairchild has experimentaly extended CIE Lightness
        to a modest level of 400
        (4x media white)
        with HDR-Lab and HDR-IPT
        [<a href="#HDR-Lab">HDR-Lab</a>].

        Meanwhile the TV and movie industry,
        and the related field of 3D computer graphics,
        has advanced and is generating,
        manipulating
        and distributing to consumers,
        HDR content with dynamic ranges of 4000:1
        or higher.

        <h2>HDR luminance levels</h2>
        <p>
        Current HDR video broadcasts conform to [<a href="#BT.2100">BT.2100</a>]
        which supports two transfer functions:
        one is scene referred,
        with relative luminance and suitable for variable viewing conditions
        (Hybrid Log Gamma, HLG)
        and the other
        is display-referred,
        with absolute luminance and suitable for fixed, dark viewing conditions
        (Perceptual Quantizer, PQ),
        originally published as [<a href="#SMPTE-ST-2084">SMPTE-ST-2084</a>];
        the latter requires re-rendering for other viewing environments.
        </p>

        <!-- how to cite Craig Revie "High Dynamic Range Imaging Is there a role for ICC ?" -->
        <p>
        Rec.2100 supports (peak, small-area) luminances up to 12x media white (HLG)
        or 71.4x media white (PQ).
        Dark colors significantly below
        those suported by Standard Dynamic Range (SDR)
        once viewing flare is taken into account,
        are also supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            The various conformance levels of the VESA
            Certified DisplayHDR conformance specification
            [<a href="#DisplayHDR">Certified DisplayHDR</a>]
            require Minimum Peak Luminance
            ranging from 500 to 1400 cd/m²,
            and corresponding Maximum Black luminance
            ranging from 0.1 to 0.02 cd/m²;
            the simultaneous dynamic range is thus greater than 70,000.
            Meanwhile the highest "True Black" conformance levels
            require a Maximum Black Level Luminance
            of 0.0005 cd/m² (although so far, only with a minimum peak of 500).
        </p>
        <p>
            For HLG,
            diffuse white is placed at a code value of 0.75
            (75 "IRE"),
            which allocates three quarters of the code space
            for commonly occuring, SDR colors;
            and leaves 3.5 stops (12x diffuse white)
            for highlights.
            The absolute luminance of the diffuse white in HLG
            thus varies with display brightness,
            which can be adapted to suit viewing conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For PQ, diffuse white depends on the absolute luminance and varies,
            although recommendations are emerging for indoor and outdoor scenes
            [<a href="#Dolby-PQ-levels">Dolby-PQ-levels</a>],
            [<a href="#BT.2048">BT.2048</a>].
            Around 5.5 stops are reserved for specular highlights
            (calculations vary depending on the assumptions made).
            The difference beweeen the live-broadcast focussed HLG
            and the movie oriented PQ has been summed up
            [<a href="#Borer-Cotton">Borer &amp; Cotton</a>]

        <p>
        Besides HDR video, there is interest
        in distributing HDR still-image content,
        either stills from video content,
        or HDR graphic arts content.

        <h2>The ICC Profile Connection Space</h2>
        <p>
        ICC (4.3 and Max) currently allows either CIE XYZ or CIE Lab
        as Profile Connection Space.
        </p>
        <p>
        CIE XYZ is unbounded, and used for HDR by ACES and OpenEXR (see <a href="#appendix">appendix</a>);
        while
        CIE Lab is bounded to L=100 at media white
        (perfect diffuse reflector).
        </p>
        <p>
        Arbitrarily placing the HDR peak intensity white at L=100
        grossly distorts the Lightness curve,
        and would not
        be a good Lightness predictor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Fairchild has shown that L can be extended to 400,
        [<a href="#HDR-Lab">HDR-Lab</a>]
        but this would constitute an additional PCS
        rather than a revision of the existing one.
        The idea of adding an additional ICC PCS is not new;
        Tastl et al have explored using CIECAM02 as an ICC PCS
        [<a href="#ICC_CIECAM02">ICC CIECAM02</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
        Safdar et al have proposed J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, an HDR-capable uniform colorspace [<a href="#Safdar-PUCS">Safdar-PUCS</a>].
        J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> uses (a modified) PQ transfer function,
        claims to correct the CIE Lab hue non-linearity,
        is computationally less complex than CIECAM02 or CIECAM16,
        and has an associated deltaE metric
        which is (compared to deltaE 2000) computationally simple
        and could be used for gamut mapping operations.
        Unlike CIECAM02 [<a href="#ICC_CIECAM02">ICC CIECAM02</a>], it is invertible.
        </p>
        <p>
        This paper therefore examines J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> as a potential HDR ICC PCS.

        <h2>J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub></h2>
        <span class="todo">(describe goals from paper)</span>

        <p>
        The input to J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> is absolute CIE XYZ, with a D65 whitepoint.
        Since ICC uses CIE XYZ as a PCS,
        and since ICCMax allows non-D50 whitepoints,
        it seems feasible that a future version of the ICC specification
        could add J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> as an additional PCS for processing of HDR data.

        <p>
        The present author
        <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/color.js/tree/master/src/spaces">implemented
        J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> and J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub></a> as part of a
        <a href="https://colorjs.io/">JavaScript color library</a>.
        The implementation was checked against published Matlab code,
        but is as yet unreleased as it needs more testing to be certain of correctness.

            <h3>Transfer curve</h3>
            <p>
            The J<sub>z</sub> component, termed Brightness,
            is the perceptually uniform correlate of Luminance
            in the J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> model.
            The transfer curve is strongly influenced by,
            but not identical to,
            the Dolby PQ curve used in Rec.2100;
            like PQ, the luminance range is absolute and ranges from
            0 to 10,000 cd/m².
            </p>
            <p>
            The authors of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>
            do not specifically address
            where in this range
            the media white should be placed,
            although this is a critical item both for viewer comfort
            and for the integration of SDR and HDR content in a single program.
            Dolby conducted a histogram analysis of
            HDR and SDR graded indoor scenes from cinematic content for home distribution.
            Their Reference Level Guidelines for PQ [<a href="#"Dolby-PQ-levels">Dolby-PQ-levels</a>]
            give the encoded PQ values of
            0.34 for an 18% gray card (17 cd/m²)
            and go on to deduce the corresponding level of 0.54
            for a media 'diffuse white' (100% reflectance) illuminated at 140 cd/m².
            Their analysis found outdoor scenes to be 1.7 stops higher in exposure,
            placing an 18% grey card at 57 cd/m² and a PQ value of 0.45,
            with diffuse white at 425 cd/m² and a PQ value of 0.66.
            </p>
            <p>
            The implementation by the present author therefore places the media whitepoint
            for all SDR RGB colorspaces at PQ of 0.54, corresponding to 140 cd/m².
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast, [<a href="#BT.2048">BT.2048</a>] lists higher "nominal" values,
                placing an 18% grey card at a luminance of 26 cd/m²
                (PQ 0.38, HLG 0.38)
                and diffuse white at 203  cd/m²
                (PQ 0.58, HLG 0.75).
                They caution that:

            <blockquote>However, for both types of content
                the spread around this mean value is significant,
                indicating that in practice the measured white levels
                can be expected to vary significantly around this target value

            <h3>DeltaE</h3>

            <p>
            Because many of the limitations of CIE Lab are claimed to be corrected
            in the computation of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>,
            then unlike the relatively complicated ΔE2000 metric,
            the ΔEJ<sub>z</sub> metric uses a simple root sum of squares in
            J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>:
            </p>
            <p class="equation">
                ΔEJ<sub>z = √(ΔJ<sub>z</sub>² + ΔC<sub>z</sub>² + Δh<sub>z</sub>²)
            </p>
            <p>
            where, as with CIE LCH, Δh<sub>z</sub> is the length of the chord:
            </p>
            <p  class="equation">
                Δh<sub>z</sub> = 2 × √(C<sub>z</sub>1 × C<sub>z</sub>2) × sin(Δh), <i>Δh in radians</i>

            <p>
            It is immediately apparent that the ΔEJ<sub>z</sub> metric has a very different range.
            As expected, ΔE76 over-estimates for high-chroma pairs,
            while ΔECMC(2:1) and ΔE2000 are at least comparable in magnitude.
            </p>
            <p>
            While not necessarily an issue for automated tasks such as gamut mapping,
            the very small values for the ΔEJ<sub>z</sub> distance metric might prove a barrier to
            acceptability or perceptibility use, or to client-vendor communication.

                <!-- does this really fit here?-->
                Rousselot <i>et. al.</i>
                [<a href="#Quality_Assesment_HDR">Quality Assesment HDR</a>]
                examined HDR image quality metrics
                using ICtCp, J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, and HDR-Lab.
                12 SDR metrics were extended to HDR,
                and two new HDR metrics were proposed.
                Among their conclusions,
                they cited lack of clarity in the white point used for color grading
                and suggested use of the HLG transfer function.
                They suggest the blue hue deviation correction
                makes the J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> color space more sensitive
                to gamut mismatch distortions.
                They also cite [<a href="#BT.2048">BT.2408</a>] for a
                diffuse white point luminance
                of 203 cd/m² for IC<sub>T</sub>C<sub>P</sub>
                and suggest a white point for
                J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>
                of 997 cd/m², and repeatedly stress
                the diffuse white luminance values used in image preparation
                as critical to which of the tested UCS will perform best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Extended SDR metrics tend to suffer from only considering
                the luminance aspect
                (Rousselot describes these as "color blind" metrics).
                Many existing test images are contained within the BT.709 gamut,
                and even those using BT.2020 or BT.2100
                are lacking in non-neutral, let alone high-chroma
                samples above media white.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar limitations apply to the experiments leading to
                HDR-Lab and HDR-IPT [<a href="#HDR-Lab">HDR-Lab</a>];
                the data were obtained
                from observer evaluation of monochrome patches
                with a diffuse white of 997 cd/m²
                and luminance levels up to 2x diffuse white.
                The transfer function matches CIE L up to 1x diffuse white,
                and uses the Michaelis-Menten equation
                up to 4x diffuse white.
                For evaluation of Chroma, hue linearity, and hue spacing
                the Munsell Renotation values were used,
                which clearly are an SDR data set.

        <h2>Gamut mapping</h2>
        <p>
        Gamut compression from an SDR, WCG display
        to a SCG display
        has been investigated by Xu et al
        [<a href="#CGM-Vividness">CGM-Vividness</a>],
        [<a href="Gamut_Compression">Gamut Compression</a>]
        who compared CIE Lab, CAM02-UCS and J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>.
        Six global and two local (spatial) GMAs were tested.
        Their algorithms included Vividness Preserving
        (distance from the blackpoint)
        and Depth Preserving (distance from media white);
        the latter did not perform well.
        Their conclusions included the statement that
        "J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> is a promising UCS for gamut mapping".
        However, only the WCG aspect of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> was investigated, not the HDR aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
        To simulate a constant-lightness, hue preserving GMA,
        the present author implemented J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>, and the J<sub>z</sub> distance metric;
        then plotted the progressive Chroma reduction
        of two blues (sRGB primary blue and Rec.2020 primary blue)
        in two UCS: CIE LCH and J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>.
        Blue was chosen to investigate the hue linearity,
        which is known to be problematic for CIE Lab.
        </p>

            <img src="sRGB-blue-lab.svg" style="width: 80vw"/>
            <figcaption>Above: sRGB blue, with progressive reduction of
            CIE LCH Chroma to the neutral axis.<br>

            Below, linear-light sRGB primary intensities.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        For the LCH chroma reduction,
        a shift towards purple is easily seen
        and the RGB levels clearly indicate that
        the red component is rising faster than the green.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub> chroma reduction,
        the objectionable purple shift
        is replaced by a worrying cyan shift,
        and the green component is rising faster than the red.
        In addition, the three components do not fully converge to the neutral axis.
        </p>
        <p>
        Having examined a SCG mapping, as a WCG colorspace Rec.2020 blue was tested.
        The color ramps are converted to sRGB for display; salmon indicates out-of-gamut colors.
        </p>
        <p>
        <figure>
            <img src="rec2020-lab.svg" style="width: 80vw"/>
            <figcaption>Above: Rec.2020 blue, with progressive reduction of
            CIE LCH Chroma to the neutral axis.<br>
            Below, linear-light Rec.2020 primary intensities.</figcaption>

        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        The same tendencies
        (an excess of red in LCH,
        and of green in J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>)
        were noted,
        although only a portion of the generated color ramp
        could be visualized due to display gamut limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is hypothesized that the shift from blue to purple,
        which crosses a color name boundary,
        is visualy more noticeable than
        the shift from deep blue to cyan blue,
        which does not.

        <h2>Tentative Conclusions, &amp; Further Work</h2>
        <p>
            Tastl <i>et. al.</i> concluded [<a href="ICC_CIECAM02">ICC CIECAM02</a>]:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Trying to use CIECAM02 within an ICC framework is not as
            simple as switching from XYZ to CIELAB. It requires careful
            thought about the goals that one hopes to achieve, careful
            selection of the CIECAM02 input parameters and management of
            the expectations. It is not the answer to all the problems and it
            also produces new problems that have to be dealt with in an
            appropriate way.
        </blockquote>
        <p>The same caveats apply to the use of
            J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>
            within an ICC framework.
            Having said which:
        </p>
        <p>
        The PQ transfer curve is specific to a reference display
        in a dim viewing environment.
        The positioning of diffuse, media white is subject to debate
        and the re-rendering required for non-dim viewing environments is poorly defined.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is possible that a UCS with the HLG transfer curve might
        be more widely applicable to a range of viewing environments
        and allocate more of the code space to commonly occurring colors.
        </p>
        <p>
        The hue linearity of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> needs to be further investigated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Performance of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>with non-neutral, high chroma colors is inadequately explored.
        </p>
        <p>
        The values for J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub> brightness and chroma,
        and the values for deltaE,
        are too small for easy comprehension
        or comparison with other systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Beyond that, no conclusions are presented at this stage.
        <p>

        <p>
        Much further work remains to be done
        to even understand the goals of HDR-capable ICC manipulation of color.
        In addition to merely progressing from colorimetry to color appearance models:
        spatial effects and image appearance models,
        tone mapping/color re-rendering,
        user expectations and
        applicability to a range of viewing environments
        are increasingly important for satisfactory rendering of still,
        let alone moving,
        HDR content.

            <h3>ITU Rec. BT.2100</h3>
            <p>This uses the same ultrawide gamut
                primaries as ITU Rec. BT.2020;
                while physically realisable in principle,
                they lie right on the spectral locus
                which limits their brightness
                and exacerbates observer metamerism.
            </p>
            <p>
                It specifies two transfer curves.
                One is Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG),
                which uses relative luminances
                and can be used with a range of viewing conditions
                by scaling the peak luminance;
                and the other is Perceptual Quantizer (PQ),
                which uses absolute luminances
                and requires a dark viewing environment (??? cd/m2).
            </p>
            <p>
                These colorspaces are in current use for the bradcast of HDR content
                (movies, news, still images) and for UHD Blu-Ray.
                The effective gamut usage is not full,
                but is still somewhat greater than
                the DCI-p3 gamut.

            <h3>ProPhoto RGB</h3>
            <p>
                Originally proposed by Kodak as the Reference Output Medium (ROMM) colorspace,
this is an ultrawide gamut, output referred, RGB space.
            </p>
            <p>
                As two of the three primaries are outside the spectral locus,
                ProPhoto RGB is often used as a Camera RAW decoding target
                (for example, by Adobe Lightroom)
                to avoid gamut compression in the early stages of photomanipulation
                and as a master archival format for digital photography.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some HDR still images use this format, often by exposure stacking
                (taking mid-range luminances from a series of photographs
                with different exposure settings,
                or with different exposure conversions from the linear RAW original photo).
            </p>
            <p>
                Most current workflow does use ICC profiles. However,
                the transfer function is a 1.8 gamma
                with a small linear to to constrain the slope near zero to 16.
                A widely distributed ICC profile uses a simple 1.8 gamma,
                which relies on a poorly-documented feature of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop
                which constrain the slope near zero to 16.
                Such profiles would not necessarily be interoperable with other software.

                which was contributed by Industrial Light & Magic
                and is similar to a shader language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Various output transforms are defined,
                which vary with monitor colorimetry;
                and peak white level.
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>P3-D65 ST.2084 (1,000 cd/m²)</li>
                <li>P3-D65 ST.2084 (4,000 cd/m²)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>OpenEXR</h3>
            <p>OpenEXR is a high-dynamic-range, 2D image file format
                developed by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for use in computer imaging applications.
                For linear images, the 'half float' format
                provides 1024 values per color component per f-stop,
                and 30 f-stops;
                an additional 10 f-stops with reduced precision
                are available at the low end (denormals).
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenEXR supports RGB, XYZ, and YCbCr colors.
                It allows storage of the
                red, green, blue and white chromaticities
                [<a href="#OpenEXRIntro">OpenEXR Intro</a>].
                However
                <q>The chromaticities attribute is optional, and many
                    programs that write OpenEXR omit it.</q>
