        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
        Traditional color management,
        with a focus on the reproduction of printed imagery,
        has concerned itself with a restricted dynamic range;
        typically less than 90:1, it is
        formed by the deepest multi-ink black, on the one hand,
        and paper white
        seen under a not especially bright illuminant (??? cd/m2)
        (get viewing cabinet values)
        on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
        Developments in display technology
        increased this, but it was still bounded by display flare (at the dark end)
        and modest peak luminances of 200 cd/m² or so at the high end,
        giving a linear dynamic range of 1000:1 or so.
        </p>
        <p>
        Real-world scenes (from Fairchild, simultaneous dynamic range)
        specular hilights, deep shadows

        Experiments to extend L to a modest level of 400
        (4x media white)
        (hdr-CIELAB, hdr-IPT).
        </p>
        <p>
        Meanwhile the TV and movie industry,
        and the related field of 3D computer graphics,
        has advanced and is generating,
        manipulating
        and distributing to consumers,
        HDR content with dynamic ranges of 4000:1
        or higher.

        <h1>HDR luminance levels</h1>
        <p>
        Current HDR video broadcasts conform to [Rec.2100]
        which supports two transfer functions:
        one with relative luminance and suitable for variable viewing conditions
        (Hybrid Log Gamma, HLG)
        and the other with absolute luminance and suitable for fixed, dark viewing conditions
        (Perceptual Quantizer, PQ);
        the latter requires re-rendering for other viewing environments.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rec.2100 supports (peak, small-area) luminances up to 12x media white (HLG)
        or 71.4x media white (PQ).
        Dark colors significantly below
        those suported by Standard Dynamic Range (SDR)
        once viewing flare is taken into account,
        are also supported.

        <p>
        Besides video, there is interest in distributing HDR still-image content,
        either stills from video content,
        or HDR graphic arts content.

        <h1>The ICC Profile Connection Space</h1>
        <p>
        ICC (4.3 and Max) currently allows XYZ and Lab as Profile Connection Space.
        </p>
        <p>
        XYZ is unbounded, and used for HDR by ACES (see below).
        </p>
        <p>
        Lab is bounded to L=100 at media white.
        ??? has shown that L can be extended to 400
        ??? has shown that L is a poor predictor of Lightness beyond 400
        </p>
        <p>
        Arbitrarily placing the peak intensity white at L=100
        distorts the Lightness curve and would not (??? why)
        be a good Lightnes predictor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Modifications to CIE Lab, such as [HDR-Lab] and [???]
        are known, but would constitute an additional PCS.
        The idea of adding an additional PCS is not new;
        Tastl et al have explored using CIECAM02 as an ICC PCS [ICC CIECAM02].
        </p>
        <p>
        Safdar et al [] have proposed J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, and HDR-capable uniform colorspace [Safdar-PUCS].
        J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> uses (a modified) PQ transfer function,
        claims to correct the CIE Lab hue non-linearity,
        is computationally less complex than CIECAM02 or CIECAM16,
        and has an associated deltaE metric
        which is (compared to deltaE 2000) computationally simple
        and could be used for gamut mapping operations.
        </p>
        <p>
        This paper therefore examines J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> as a potential HDR ICC PCS.

        <h1>J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub></h1>
        (describe)

    (goals from paper)

        <p>
        The input to J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> is absolute CIE XYZ, with a D65 whitepoint.
        ?? scene referred or output referred?
        Since ICC uses CIE XYZ as a PCS,
        and since ICCMax allows non-D50 whitepoints,
        it seems feasible that a future version of the ICC specification
        could add J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> as an additional PCS for processing of HDR data.

        The present author
        <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/color.js/tree/master/src/spaces">implemented
        J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> and J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub></a> as part of a
        <a href="https://colorjs.io/">JavaScript color library</a>.
        The implementation was checked against published Matlab code,
        but is as yet unreleased as it needs more testing to be certain of correctness.
        </p>

            <h1>Transfer curve</h1>
            <p>
            The J<sub>z</sub> component, termed Brightness,
            is the perceptually uniform correlate of Luminance
            in the J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> model.
            The transfer curve is strongly influenced by,
            but not identical to,
            the Dolby PQ curve used in Rec.2100;
            like PQ, the luminance range is absolute and ranges from
            0 to 10,000 cd/m².
            </p>
            <p>
            The authors of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>
            do not specifically address
            where in this range
            the media white should be placed,
            although this is a critical item both for viewer comfort
            and for the integration of SDR and HDR content in a single program.
            Dolby conducted a histogram analysis of
            HDR and SDR graded indoor scenes from cinematic content for home distribution.
            Their Reference Level Guidelines for PQ [Dolby-PQ-levels]
            give the encoded PQ values of
            0.34 for an 18% gray card (17 cd/m²)
            and go on to deduce the corresponding level of 0.54
            for a media 'diffuse white' (100% reflectance) illuminated at 140 cd/m².
            Their analysis found outdoor scenes to be 1.7 stops higher in exposure,
            placing an 18% grey card at 57 cd/m² and a PQ value of 0.45,
            with diffuse white at 425 cd/m² and a PQ value of 0.66.
            </p>
            <p>
            The implementation by the present author therefore places the media whitepoint
            for all SDR RGB colorspaces at PQ of 0.54, corresponding to 140 cd/m².

                Like the equations for deltaE2000,
                J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> introduces a correction term for
                the deep blue to purple non-linearity of Lab and CIECAM02

            has a CIE LCH Chroma of 132 but a J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub> Chroma of 0.156.

            <h1>DeltaE</h1>
            <p>
            <!-- does this really fit here?-->
            Rousselot et.  al. [Quality Assesment HDR] examined HDR image quality metrics
            using ICtCp, J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, and HDR-Lab.
            12 SDR metrics were extended to HDR,
            and two new HDR metrics were proposed.
            </p>

            <p>
            Because many of the limitations of CIE Lab are corrected in the computation of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>,
            then unlike the relatively complicated deltaE2000 metric,
            the deltaE metric uses a simple linear root sum of squares in J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>:
            </p>
            <p>
                ΔE = √(ΔJ<sub>z</sub>² + ΔC<sub>z</sub>² + Δh<sub>z</sub>²)
            </p>
            <p>
            where, as with CIE LCH, Δh<sub>z</sub> is the length of the chord:
            </p>
            <p>
                Δh<sub>z</sub> = 2 × √(C<sub>z</sub>1 × C<sub>z</sub>2) × sin(Δh), Δh in radians
            </p>
            <p>
            This metric was
            <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/color.js/tree/master/src/deltaE">implemented</a>
            and
            <a href="https://colorjs.io/tests/delta.html">tested</a>
            against 76, CMC(2,1) and deltaE2000.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is immediately apparent that the metric has a very different range.
            </p>
                (table with white-to-black, Sharma "large delta E", and small deltaE comparisons.)
            <p>
            While not necessarily an issue for automated tasks such as gamut mapping,
            the very small values for this distance metric might prove a barrier to
            acceptability or perceptibility use or client-vendor communication.

        <h1>Gamut mapping</h1>
        <p>
        Gamut compression from an SDR, WCG display
        to a SCG display
        has been investigated by Xu et al
        [CGM-Vividness], [Gamut Compression]
        who compared CIE Lab, CAM02-UCS and J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>.
        Six global and two local (spatial) GMAs were tested.
        Their algorithms included Vividness Preserving
        (distance from the blackpoint)
        and Depth Preserving (distance from media white);
        the latter did not perform well.
        Their conclusions included the statement that
        "J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> is a promising UCS for gamut mapping".
        However, only the WCG aspect of J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub> was investigated, not the HDR aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
        To simulate a constant-lightness, hue preserving GMA,
        the present author implemented J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>, J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>, and the J<sub>z</sub> distance metric;
        then plotted the progressive Chroma reduction
        of two blues (sRGB primary blue and Rec.2020 primary blue)
        in two UCS: CIE LCH and J<sub>z</sub>a<sub>z</sub>b<sub>z</sub>.
        Blue was chosen to investigate the hue linearity,
        which is known to be problematic for CIE Lab.

        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        For the LCH chroma reduction,
        a shift towards purple is easily seen
        and the RGB levels clearly indicate that
        the red component is rising faster than the green.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub> chroma reduction,
        the objectionable purple shift
        is replaced by a worrying cyan shift,
        and the green component is rising faster than the red.
        In addition, the three components do not fully converge to the neutral axis.
        </p>
        <p>
        Having examined a SCG mapping, as a WCG colorspace Rec.2020 blue was tested.
        The color ramps are converted to sRGB for display; salmon indicates out-of-gamut colors.

        </p>
        <p>
        The same tendencies
        (an excess of red in LCH,
        and of green in J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub>)
        were noted,
        although only a portion of the generated color ramp
        could be visualized due to display gamut limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is hypothesized that the shift from blue to purple,
        which crosses a color name boundary,
        is visualy more noticeable than
        the shift from deep blue to cyan blue,
        which does not.

        <h1>Further Work</h1>
        <p>
        It is possible that a UCS with the HLG transfer curve might
        be more widely applicable to a range of viewing environments
        and allocate more of the code space to commonly occurring colors.

        The hue linearity needs to be further investigated.

        Performance with non-neutral, high chroma colors is inadequately explored.

        The values for J<sub>z</sub>C<sub>z</sub>h<sub>z</sub> brightness and chroma,
        and the values for deltaE,
        are too small for easy comprehension
        or comparison with other systems.

        Beyond that, no conclusions are presented at this stage.
        <p>

        <p>
        Much further work remains to be done
        to even understand the goals of HDR-capable ICC manipulation of color.
        In addition to merely progressing from colorimetry to color appearance models:
        spatial effects and image appearance models,
        tone mapping/color re-rendering,
        user expectations and
        the range of viewing environments
        are increasingly important for satisfactory rendering of still,
        let alone moving,
        HDR content.

            <p>This uses the same ultrawide gamut
                primaries as ITU Rec. BT.2020;
                while physically realisable in principle,
                they lie right on the spectral locus
                which limits their brightness
                and exacerbates observer metamerism.

                It specifies two transfer curves.
                One is Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG),
                which uses relative luminances
                and can be used with a range of viewing conditions
                by scaling the peak luminance;
                and the other is Perceptual Quantizer (PQ),
                which uses absolute luminances
                and requires a dark viewing environment (??? cd/m2).
            </p>
            <p>
                These colorspaces are in current use for the bradcast of HDR content
                (movies, news, still images) and for UHD Blu-Ray.
                The effective gamut usage is not full,
                but is still somewhat greater than
                the DCI-p3 gamut.

            <h1>ProPhoto RGB</h1>
            <p>
                Originally proposed by Kodak as the Reference Output Medium (ROMM) colorspace,
this is an ultrawide gamut, output referred, RGB space.
            </p>
            <p>
                As two of the three primaries are outside the spectral locus,
                ProPhoto RGB is often used as a Camera RAW decoding target
                (for example, by Adobe Lightroom)
                to avoid gamut compression in the early stages of photomanipulation
                and as a master archival format for digital photography.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some HDR still images use this format, often by exposure stacking
                (taking mid-range luminances from a series of photographs
                with different exposure settings,
                or with different exposure conversions from the linear RAW original photo).
            </p>
            <p>
                Most current workflow does use ICC profiles. However,
                the transfer function is a 1.8 gamma
                with a small linear to to constrain the slope near zero to 16.
                A widely distributed ICC profile uses a simple 1.8 gamma,
                which relies on a poorly-documented feature of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop
                which constrain the slope near zero to 16.
                Such profiles would not necessarily be interoperable with other software.

            <h1>OpenEXR</h1>
            <p>OpenEXR is a high-dynamic-range, 2D image file format
                developed by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) for use in computer imaging applications.
                For linear images, the 'half float' format
                provides 1024 values per color component per f-stop,
                and 30 f-stops;
                an additional 10 f-stops with reduced precision
                are available at the low end (denormals).
